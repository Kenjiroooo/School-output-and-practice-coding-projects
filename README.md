This repository contains my school project codes and documentation, mainly focused on Arduino-based projects such as a smart robot line follower using IR sensors. The purpose of this repository is to upload, organize, and track all my project progress, experiments, and improvements throughout the development process. Each code file includes comments that explain how the program works and what I learned while implementing it. In addition to Arduino, this repository may also include other topics related to electronics, robotics, programming, and embedded systems. This serves as both a learning record and a reference for future projects and improvements.This repository contains my school project codes and documentation, mainly focused on Arduino-based projects such as a smart robot line follower using IR sensors, Humidity and Temperature Sensors, Robotic Arm and etc. The purpose of this repository is to upload, organize, and track all my project progress, experiments, and improvements throughout the development process.
